# Custom-Keyboard
This repository hosts source files for my first custom keyboard.

## Layout
Layout is available in json format and meant to be opened on [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com).

## Firmware
[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)

## Hardware
Gerber available.
BOM should be available one day. Maybe.

## Down sides
The PCB has not been designed to be used with PCB mounted switch, as I only had plate mounted switch available.
